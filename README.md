## Quick Start Guide
Install and have your USB Rubber Ducky working in less than 5 minutes.

1. Download the latest release from the [Releases]([https://github.com/dbisu/pico-ducky/releases](https://github.com/catcraft/pico-ducky-mod/releases/tag/V1)) page (Die uf2 datei (Firmeware)).

2. Plug the device into a USB port while holding the boot button. It will show up as a removable media device named RPI-RP2.

3. Install CircutlPython on the Pico or Pico W

If using a Pico board:

Copy the adafruit-circuitpython-raspberry_pi_pico-de_DE-8.0.0.uf2 file to the root of the Pico (RPI-RP2). The device will reboot and after a second or so, it will reconnect as CIRCUITPY.

4. Copy the lib folder to the root of the CIRCUITPY

5. Copy *.py to the root of the CIRCUITPY

6. Be careful, if your device isn't in [setup mode](#setup-mode), the device will reboot and after half a second, the script will run.

Copy your payload as payload.dd to the root of the CIRCUITPY

7. Unplug the device from the USB port and remove the setup jumper.

Enjoy your Pico-Ducky.

## Mir bekannti Problem

- Eigentli keine, manchmal Tweaken die Raspis, dann muss man sie vlt neu aufsetzen wenn man pech hat

- Bi frage chansch di bi mir au uf disc melde: @cat_craft oder mini nummer hesch probably 

## Setup mode

To edit the payload, enter setup mode by connecting the pin 1 (`GP0`) to pin 3 (`GND`), this will stop the pico-ducky from injecting the payload in your own machine.
The easiest way to do so is by using a jumper wire between those pins as seen bellow.

## USB enable/disable mode

If you need the pico-ducky to not show up as a USB mass storage device for stealth, follow these instructions.  
- Enter setup mode.    
- Copy your payload script to the pico-ducky.  
- Disconnect the pico from your host PC.
- Connect a jumper wire between pin 18 (`GND`) and pin 20 (`GPIO15`).  
This will prevent the pico-ducky from showing up as a USB drive when plugged into the target computer.  
- Remove the jumper and reconnect to your PC to reprogram.  

Pico: The default mode is USB mass storage enabled.   
Pico W: The default mode is USB mass storage **disabled**

### Pico W Web Service
The Pico W AP defaults to ip address `192.168.4.1`.  You should be able to find the webservice at `http://192.168.4.1:80`  

The following endpoints are available on the webservice:
```
/
/new
/ducky
/edit/<filename>
/write/<filename>
/run/<filename>
```

API endpoints
```
/api/run/<filenumber>
```

## Multiple payloads

Multiple payloads can be stored on the Pico and Pico W.  
To select a payload, ground one of these pins:
- GP4 - payload.dd
- GP5 - payload2.dd
- GP10 - payload3.dd
- GP11 - payload4.dd

## Changing Keyboard Layouts (Ich m√ºst die aleitig no apasse, han aber grad kb (de weg unde funktioniert nid ganz))

Copied from [Neradoc/Circuitpython_Keyboard_Layouts](https://github.com/Neradoc/Circuitpython_Keyboard_Layouts/blob/main/PICODUCKY.md)  

#### How to use one of these layouts with the pico-ducky repository.

**Go to the [latest release page](https://github.com/Neradoc/Circuitpython_Keyboard_Layouts/releases/latest), look if your language is in the list.**

#### If your language/layout is in the bundle

Download the `py` zip, named `circuitpython-keyboard-layouts-py-XXXXXXXX.zip`

**NOTE: You can use the mpy version targetting the version of Circuitpython that is on the device, but on Raspberry Pi Pico you don't need it - they only reduce file size and memory use on load, which the pico has plenty of.**

#### If your language/layout is not in the bundle

Try the online generator, it should get you a zip file with the bundles for yout language

https://www.neradoc.me/layouts/

#### Now you have a zip file

#### Find your language/layout in the lib directory

For a language `LANG`, copy the following files from the zip's `lib` folder to the `lib` directory of the board.  
**DO NOT** modify the adafruit_hid directory. Your files go directly in `lib`.  
**DO NOT** change the names or extensions of the files. Just pick the right ones.  
Replace `LANG` with the letters for your language of choice.

- `keyboard_layout_win_LANG.py`
- `keycode_win_LANG.py`

Don't forget to get [the adafruit_hid library](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_HID/releases/latest).

This is what it should look like **if your language is French for example**.

![CIRCUITPY drive screenshot](https://github.com/Neradoc/Circuitpython_Keyboard_Layouts/raw/main/docs/drive_pico_ducky.png)

#### Modify the pico-ducky code to use your language file:

At the start of the file comment out these lines:

```py
from adafruit_hid.keyboard_layout_us import KeyboardLayoutUS as KeyboardLayout
from adafruit_hid.keycode import Keycode
```

Uncomment these lines:  
*Replace `LANG` with the letters for your language of choice. The name must match the file (without the py or mpy extension).*
```py
from keyboard_layout_win_LANG import KeyboardLayout
from keycode_win_LANG import Keycode
```

##### Example:  Set to German Keyboard (WIN_DE)

```py
from keyboard_layout_win_de import KeyboardLayout
from keycode_win_de import Keycode
```

Copy the files keyboard_layout_win_de.mpy and keycode_win_de.mpy to the /lib folder on the Pico board
```
adafruit_hid/
keyboard_layout_win_de.mpy
keycode_win_de.mpy
```
